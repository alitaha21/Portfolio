### Project 1: [SmartBoon](https://github.com/redaali1997/SmartBoon)

#### SmartBoon is a Laravel project meant to solve a problem of a time-based meal ordering in a college residence restaurant.
#### It deals in a good way with timing conditions. The project has many use cases for the students that can order and the method with which they can verify that they're the ones ordered that meal.
#### There's a part for Database administration. There's an API part that allows us to connect to an Android or IOS app. The API part is very simple, yet does the job in a clever way.
